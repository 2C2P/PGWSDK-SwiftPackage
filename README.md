# PGW SDK
The **2C2P Payment Gateway (PGW) SDK** allows merchants to build an excellent payment experience within their mobile apps by integrating easily with 2C2P's payment gateway. As 2C2P provides omnichannel payment processing, the Payment Gateway SDK gives merchants access to a full suite of payment options.

With 2C2P's Payment Gateway SDK, merchants do not need to undertake a complex and time-consuming PCI-DSS certification process. All sensitive information is protected at 2C2P with the most advanced security that is compliant with PCI-DSS standards.
